# Map Genius SunBiz Connector

Turns the `OWNER:` field on Map Genius for a parcel into a link to search the Florida SunBiz website's records.

# Usage

Visit the [Alachua County Map Genius](https://mapgenius.alachuacounty.us/) site and search for an address. 

Once selected, expand the "Parcel & Address" box. The extension only updates the OWNER field of this box, nowhere else on the site will it update the OWNER field. Click the name of the owner to open the SunBiz website's search.


# Installation 

Download zip file of this repo from [here](https://github.com/jonchurch/map-genius-extension/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

Extract the zip archive.

Open Google Chrome, go to Settings > Extensions.

Make sure "Developer Mode" is turned on. There is a toggle at the top right of the Extensions page.

Click on the button at top left that says "Load unpacked". Find the folder you extracted earlier. Select the `src/` folder (the folder that contains `manifest.json`).

The extension should now be loaded.
